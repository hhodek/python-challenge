# Python Challenge

# Description
For this assignment, the goal was to complete two challenges using Python. The first challenge, PyBank, involved analyzing the financial records of a company. A script was made to read a CSV file of budget data and generate the results of the financial analysis in the terminal. Additionally, a text file was exported to the "analysis" folder.

In the second part of the challenge, PyPoll, the objective was to assist a small, rural town in modernizing their vote-counting process by creating a python script to analyze the votes. Similar to PyBank, the results were displayed in the terminal and a text file was exported to the "analysis" folder containing the findings.

1. A "Resource" folder: This folder contains the CSV file that were read into the scripts for data analysis.

2. An "analysis" folder: This folder holds the exported text file that contain the results of the analysis performed by the scripts.

3. A "main.py" file: This file contains the complete Python script that was used for the analysis. It includes the necessary code to read the data from the CSV file in the "Resource" folder, perform the desired calculations or computations, and generate the results,  which are then exported to the "analysis" folder.
