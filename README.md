# python-challenge

# Description
For this assignment, we had 2 challenges to complete using Python. The first assignment was Pybank. For this challenge we had to create a script that read in a CSV file of budget data and generates the results of the financial analysis to the terminal, as well as exporting a textfile to the "analysis" folder. For the second part of the challenge, PyPoll, we had to help a small, rural town modernize their vote-counting process by creating a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates results.
