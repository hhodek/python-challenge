# Python Challenge

# Description
For this assignment, we had 2 challenges to complete using Python. The first assignment was Pybank which involved analyzing the financial records of a company. To do this we had to create a script that reads in a CSV file of budget data and generates the results of the financial analysis to the terminal, as well as exporting a textfile to the "analysis" folder. For the second part of the challenge, PyPoll, we were tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize their vote-counting process by creating a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates results. Like PyBank, the results are printed to the terminal and a textfile is exported to the "analysis" folder with the findings.

# Instructions
In each of the PyBank and PyPoll directories you will find 3 things: a "Resource" folder, an "analysis" folder, and a "main.py" file. The "resource" folder holds the CSV file that was read into the scripts, the "analysis" folder holds the exported textfile of the results, and the main.py has the full Python script that was used for the analysis.

# Credits
1. I worked with tutors, Richa Prakesh, on both PyPoll and PyBank scripts, & Kyle Goode helped me correct an issue with my variables (missing underscores)
2. Referenced class activities and VBA-Challenge for reading/writing files/average change calculations/loops/functions
3. Referenced Pan's repository (https://github.com/pmarbibi12/python-challenge) for coding a new line in textfiles (\n)
4. Referenced the following website for help with looping functions in Pypoll https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-looping-functions/
