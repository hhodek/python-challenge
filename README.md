# Python Challenge

# Description
For this assignment, the goal was to complete two challenges using Python. The first challenge, PyBank, involved analyzing the financial records of a company. A script was developed to read a CSV file of budget data and generate the results of the financial analysis in the terminal. Additionally, a text file was exported to the "analysis" folder.

In the second part of the challenge, PyPoll, the objective was to assist a small, rural town in modernizing their vote-counting process. A Python script was created to analyze the votes and calculate the results. Similar to PyBank, the results were displayed in the terminal and a text file was exported to the "analysis" folder containing the findings.

# Directory Structure
In each of the PyBank and PyPoll directories you will find 3 things: a "Resource" folder, an "analysis" folder, and a "main.py" file. The "resource" folder holds the CSV file that was read into the scripts, the "analysis" folder holds the exported textfile of the results, and the main.py has the full Python script that was used for the analysis.

# Credits
